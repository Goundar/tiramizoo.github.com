title: Plugins for eCommerce Solutions
---

Tiramizoo is providing plugins for easy integration of tiramizoo into
common eCommerce solutions.

Currently there is an osCommerce plugin as well as an xt:Commerce
plugin. We are actively working on OXID and magento plugins as well and
will likely extract common functionality into a PHP library soon.

The source code for all plugins is freely available on github.com - if you
find any bugs, please report them at the github issues page for the
plugin. Of course we are also happy about code contributions, e.g. bug
fixes or new features.
