## Package labeling process

#### Package identifier / QR code url

During order creation process ([More](/orders.html)) each package is generated:

- unique identification number ("identifier")     <- Information to be encoded in qr code
- api url to obtain qr code image ("qr_code_url") <- Api url to obtain qr code image

Example order creation response:

{% highlight javascript %}
{

      "uuid": "a505ff78-67c5-4fbd-ab4f-a8db81f2c45a",
      "state": "processing",
      "created_at": "2013-03-12T11:13:46+01:00",
      "description": "rubber chickens and chunky bacon",
      ...
      "packages": [
        {
          "width": 2,
          "height": 8.2,
          "length": 5,
          "weight": 2,
          "quantity": 1,
          "description": "chunky bacon",
          "identifier": "3E39C50E40226436",
          "qr_code_url": "/api/v1/qr_codes/3E39C50E40226436"
        }
      ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

To obtain qr code you just need to send request with package identifier 

All requests require authentication (valid **API_TOKEN**  [More](/#api_tokens) )

#### Get qr code

```
GET /qr_codes/:identifier?api_token=API_TOKEN
```

* `identifier` - Each order package generated by the system contains uniqe identifier ([More](/orders.html#show_order))


#### Response

Api response with qr code image in 'png' format 

##### Try it yourself #####
